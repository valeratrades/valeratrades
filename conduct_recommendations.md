# Conduct Recommendations
Guide to interact with Valera in a way maximizing EV.

## Condition to increase interaction-frequency
very damn simple:
```rs
match "interaction with you increases my chances of achieving my goal over the long term" {
  true => "I will push for increased frequency of interaction until it doesn't.",
  false => "I will do my best to distance myself as quickly as possible.",
}
```

## My Goals
I must reach the 4 standard deviations of trading skill level.

That translates to being number 1 out of 31574. This is practically unattainable level, and I must dedicate entirety of my life to just the right activities to have any shot at it.

### Reason
I have one life. I want it to be a life of someone smart. Reaching for material targets is futile, as any worldly experience is limited by capacity of the brain processing it.

Reaching for 4std skill (or e.g., an arbitrary large number of money) is a way of quantifying intellect and "life interestingness" measurements, as both are given if one reaches these.

### NB
There are very few things that I am absolutely firm on, but my goals are in that number. If you attempt to net-negatively influence my importance estimates for them in absolute or relative terms (to other possible endeavors) - we are done that very second.

    <h4>Loophole (If you must impose your goal on me)<h4>
  </summary>

Convert the target result into side-effects of achieving/moving closer to one of my goals, and push me to converge on that instead. 

**Proposition**: In the limit efforts on anything can be translated to achieving any measurable outcome.\
**Example**: becoming best piano player in the world effectively guarantees 120wpm+ typing speed. Spending 5 years in school/university/job_market of Singapore will grant you citizenship, but having 500k+ dollars on your bank account will immediately have the same effect. (In case of France it would take 300k stake in any French market, plus 2-5 year stay in the country with no additional requirements).

- Different activities will obviously have different convergence rates: it is theoretically possible to become a billionaire working in MacDonald's, granted you live 43_000 years; but same outcome can be achieved in a few lifetimes if you are one of the best coders alive.

- Direct pursuit of a goal will obviously result in a faster convergence time, but always at the expense of other achievements.

Considering difficultly of my goal, I cannot afford to spend any amount of time optimising for secondary targets. Most areas of my life being on fire is a sign I'm doing something right. Thus the only way you can get me to arrive to your arbitrary end is by pushing me to prioritize converging to some specific points of my path, that will grant the side-effects sufficient for covering your goal for free or with now minimal effort. In most cases for that to work out I must do an extraordinary amount of work in relatively short period of time, but this is the only way to impose something on me without prompting my immediate distancing.
